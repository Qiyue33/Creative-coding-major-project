## Drive part
Perlin noise

## Introductions
Building on the group's code framework, I added a cover design and basic interaction features, while implementing growth animations for the trees. Their growth speed is controlled by Perlin noise, resulting in more natural and smooth dynamic effects.

## Image Animation
Building on the group's code, I applied the Transformations techniques learned in Week 9—using methods like translate(), rotate(), and scale()—to bring the trees to life with animation effects. I also adjusted the frameCount parameter to refine the animation (I’m not entirely certain about its exact function, so feel free to correct this part as needed). Additionally, I incorporated methods from Perlin noise (covered in Week 10), referencing elements such as for loops and relevant variables from the tutorial to design my code. 

## References Inspiration
The flickering and gradually shrinking small flowers inspired me to come up with the idea of making the trees grow and shrink progressively.

## Technical explanation
 I watched three tutorial videos on YouTube—Perlin Noise in p5.js, Perlin Noise in Two Dimensions, and What is Perlin Noise—to deepen my understanding of the concept before proceeding with this project.

I drew inspiration from the snake game example in p5.js and applied, as well as integrated, similar interaction logic into my user input functionality.
